            <p>Overview: Using function select() to generate which image to select in the given captcha.
            The images (moon, door) assembled are a combination of several shapes. Further, the function randomise() displays either of the two in each cell of the grid; created by positioning strokes on the canvas.
            Highlighted the selected cell by adding a red border and deselecting it by changing the border to its default by clicking twice.
            Indexed cells of images are to be selected in an array and compared with an array of selected cells in the verify() function. Displayed a success message if the correct set of images is selected, reinitialising the canvas and initial values if the user fails the first time and displaying a failed message the second time.
            Adjusted for mobile and desktop hardware using media query in css stylesheet.</p>
